# Supabase Storage Setup for Event Images and Exhibitor Logos

## üñºÔ∏è Storage Bucket Configuration

To enable image uploads for events and exhibitors, you need to set up storage buckets in Supabase.

### Step 1: Create Storage Buckets

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Create a new bucket** for each bucket:

#### Event Images Bucket
- **Name**: `event-images`
- **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this (so images can be accessed publicly)
- **File size limit**: 5MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*`

#### Exhibitor Logos Bucket
- **Name**: `exhibitor-logos`
- **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this (so images can be accessed publicly)
- **File size limit**: 5MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*`

### Step 2: Set Storage Policies

Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- =====================================================
-- EVENT IMAGES BUCKET POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Allow authenticated users to upload event images
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads to event-images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'event-images' AND 
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow public access to view event images
CREATE POLICY "Allow public viewing of event-images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'event-images');

-- Allow users to update their own event image uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates to event-images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'event-images' AND 
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow users to delete their own event image uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes from event-images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'event-images' AND 
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- =====================================================
-- EXHIBITOR LOGOS BUCKET POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Allow authenticated users to upload exhibitor logos
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads to exhibitor-logos" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'exhibitor-logos' AND 
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow public access to view exhibitor logos
CREATE POLICY "Allow public viewing of exhibitor-logos" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'exhibitor-logos');

-- Allow users to update their own exhibitor logo uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates to exhibitor-logos" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'exhibitor-logos' AND 
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow users to delete their own exhibitor logo uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes from exhibitor-logos" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'exhibitor-logos' AND 
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup

After setup, you should be able to:
- ‚úÖ Upload event images through CreateEvent and EditEvent forms
- ‚úÖ Upload exhibitor logos through AddExhibitor and EditExhibitor forms
- ‚úÖ View images in the event and exhibitor lists
- ‚úÖ Images are stored securely in Supabase storage
- ‚úÖ Images are accessible via public URLs
